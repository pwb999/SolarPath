# SolarPath


## TestFlight Version 4.0 Build 1 - 13 Feb 2026     
Fresh build with same build number as Moon Path.   
These should match data and display and work as a pair.   
Note default in Location Manager of Greenwich Observatory.   
SEE NOTES for other info.

## TestFlight Version 2.0 Build 4 - 13 Feb 2026  
Added a change to sun icon from orange to grey when Altitude <0.   
Added Az sunrise and sunset values to their red/green strokes.     
Added Orange Refresh buttons to each tab.   
Removed the time from graphic display.   
Altered Solar Noon display.   
Added 360 spinner animation to all refresh buttons (see Notes for Code).    
Changed the titles + button to Z stack view so the titles are always centred.    
Note the graphic rescales dynamically according to Screen Size.   






## TestFlight Version 2.0 Build 3 - 12 Feb 2026    
NEW version of Solar Path. This is a Clone of Moon Path using Suncalc.   
This means that SP and MP look very similiar.    
Hence the new version and build number.    
Only remaining issue is the accuracy of Solar Noon time.   




## TestFlight Version 3.0 Build 5 - submitted 24 Jan 2026     
**Info.plist changed to "App uses Non-Exempt Encryption / Boolean /NO**   


## TestFlight Version 3.0 Build 4 - submitted 24 Jan 2026   
Initial simple project rebuild so that I can submit it again.    
The issue is that Apple want me to update the AGE restrictions which means I have to resubmit a new build.    

At same time decided to use Figma to create simple SVG of SP and then change its colour in Icon Composer.   
Then dragged this ICON File direct into the Xcode project and changed to Appicon reference in the Build Settings to SP.   
N.B At same time deleted everything in Assets.
