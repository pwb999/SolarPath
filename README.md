This simple App is to designed to show the Azimuth, Shadow and Altitude of the Sun derived from its GPS location.

## TestFlight Version 3.0 Build 4 - submitted 24 Jan 2026   
Initial simple project rebuild so that I can submit it again.    
The issue is that Apple want me to update the AGE restrictions which means I have to resubmit a new build.    

At same time decided to use Figma to create simple SVG of SP and then change its colour in Icon Composer.   
Then dragged this ICON File direct into the Xcode project and changed to Appicon reference in the Build Settings to SP.   
N.B At same time deleted everything in Assets.
